# Cellist
Cell identification in high-resolution Spatial Transcriptomics

Cellist is a computational method to perform cell segmentation on high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, including sequncing-based (e.g. Stereo-seq and Seq-Scope) and imaging-based (e.g. seqFISH+ and STARmap) technologies.

cd Cellist
conda create -n Cellist python=3.10
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
```bash
cellist seg --help
usage: cellist seg [-h] [--gem SPOT_EXPR_FILE] [--spot-count-h5 ALL_SPOT_COUNT_H5_FILE] [--nuclei-prop PROPS_FILE] [--nuclei-count-h5 NUCLEUS_COUNT_H5_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Input arguments:
  --gem SPOT_EXPR_FILE  Bin1 gem file generated by SAW pipeline.
  --spot-count-h5 ALL_SPOT_COUNT_H5_FILE
                        Bin1 spot-level expression file in h5 format.
  --nuclei-prop PROPS_FILE
                        Properties of segmented nucleus by Watershed algorithm.
  --nuclei-count-h5 NUCLEUS_COUNT_H5_FILE
                        Nuclei-level expression generated by Watershed segmentation with h5 format.
  --watershed-seg WATERSHED_COORD_FILE
                        Spot-level Watershed segmentation result.
  --nworkers NUM_WORKERS
                        Maximum number of workers to use.
  --patch-data-dir PATCH_DATA_DIR
                        Directory of patch data generated by Cellist (not used in the first run of Cellist).

Model arguments:
  --cell-diameter MAX_DIST
                        Expected cell diameter. Default: 15
  --spot-imputation-distance NEIGH_DIST
                        Imputation distance for each spot. Default: 5.0.
  --prob-cutoff PROB_CUTOFF
                        Cutoff for assignment probability. Default: 0.7.
  --alpha ALPHA         Weight for expression distance. Default: 0.8.
  --sigma SIGMA         Weight for regularization. Default: 1.0.
  --beta BETA           Penalty weight. Default: 10.
  --gene-use {HVG,Frequent}
                        Gene to use to calculate spot-cell distance. 'HVG' means highly variable genes, and 'Frequent' means top frequent genes. Default: HVG.
  --iteration           Iteration or not. If set, Cellist will assign non-nuclei spots iteratively with cell expression and centroid updated.
